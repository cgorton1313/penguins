Just a simple walk-thru using p5.js to explain why objects are useful.

p5.js is a Javascript implementation of Processing.

To see all the cool functionality (the API), go here: https://p5js.org/reference/

## Set up
1. You'll need a simple text editor. You do have a simple text editor don't you?
1. You'll need a browser. I KNOW you have a browser. I happen to like Chrome.
1. Create a working directory (folder) somewhere convenient. Call it "penguins"
1. Create a blank file with your text editor and save it into the /penguins directory as "penguins.html" (no quotes)
1. Create another blnak file and save it to the same place as "penguins.js" (no quotes)
