## Set up
1. You'll need a simple text editor. You do have a simple text editor don't you? (If you need a simple one for Chrome, I like [this one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/text/mmfbcljfglbokpmkimbfghdkjmjhdgbg)
1. You'll need a browser. I KNOW you have a browser. I happen to like Chrome.
1. Use the green "Clone or Download" button (above, to the right) to download a zip folder to your computer.
1. Go to that folder, unzip it, and double-click the penguins.html file to open it in a browser.

You should have an extraordinary rectangle in your browser! (Trust me, it gets better...)
