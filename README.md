# Processing Penguins

Just a simple walk-thru using p5.js to explain why "for" loops are useful.

p5.js is a Javascript implementation of Processing.

To see all the cool functionality (the API), go here: https://p5js.org/reference/

To see some really interesting examples, try: https://p5js.org/examples/

(I especially like this one: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/492096)

## Set up
1. You'll need a simple text editor. You do have a simple text editor don't you?
1. You'll need a browser. I KNOW you have a browser. I happen to like Chrome.
1. Use the green "Clone or Download" button (above, to the right) to download a zip folder to your computer.
1. Go to that folder, unzip it, and double-click the penguins.html file to open it in a browser.

You should have an extraordinary rectangle in your browser! (Trust me, it gets better...)
